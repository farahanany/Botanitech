React Native App Using Flask API and Firebase-->
This app contains a Maincontainer that handles the navigation between multiple screens.
I used the Flask API to make run the downloaded model for crop prediction.
Firebase was used for realtime monitoring. Data was retrieved from Firebase and then displayed on the mobile app screen.
A control page was added to enable the user to turn the actuator(water pump) on/off. 
A detect page was created to use the phone's camera and send the captured picture to Firebase.
The user is able to view each node and its data.
